## 👋 Hi, I'm Gyan

I'm a **Backend Developer with 3.5+ years of experience** building **high-scale backend systems** and automating cloud deployments. I specialize in **Python (Flask)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS cloud-native solutions** — delivering reliable systems that handle **200+ requests per second** with 99.95% uptime.

Currently, I’m expanding into **frontend technologies** like **Vue 3** and **Nuxt 3** to grow as a **well-rounded Full Stack Developer**.
